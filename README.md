Hello. I'm learning Ruby and my OpenBSD laptop was having problems with no-ip duc; so I decided to write my own, thus: Dynaruby, a noip client written in Ruby

Note: I don't know exactly how "slower" it will be than a pure sh client, but it's good enough and mainly just for fun

Todo:
<ol>
  <li>use http instead of curl </li>
  <li>write rc.d/dynaruby</li>
  <li>decide what to do with the installer</li>
  
</ol>
