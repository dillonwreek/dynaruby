#WORK IN PROGRESS. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. 

Hello. I'm learning Ruby and my OpenBSD laptop was having problems with no-ip duc. So I decided to write my own, thus: Dynaruby, a noip client written in Ruby

Note: I don't know exactly how "slower" it will be than a pure sh client, but it's good enough and mainly just for fun

Todo:
finish client
write rc.d/dynaruby
decide what to do with the installer
